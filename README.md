# LK-99 Hypothesis Inference
_By Marcus Schwarting_

This repository is a brief project for the 2024 LLMs for Materials hackathon. The idea is that one can assess the veracity of a scientific claim by aggregating publications on that claim, synthesizing information about those claims using a large language model, and then tracking changes in scientific consensus about that hypothesis over time.
We specifically focus on the claim that the material LK-99 was a room-temperature superconductor.
